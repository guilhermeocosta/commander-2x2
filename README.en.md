# Commander 2x2

[![Português](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-pt--BR-green)](README.md)

Welcome to Commander 2x2, a competitive Commander format for teams of two. To learn more about the format, its rules, and how to join us, visit the official website at [commander2x2.org](https://commander2x2.org).

If you're here to learn more about the project's behind-the-scenes, keep reading!

## Technologies

Commander 2x2 is meant to be a hub for our community, sharing rules, events, and decklists that achieved noticeable results. With that in mind, we chose a simple stack for static site maintenance with Astro, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI. The idea is to keep the project simple and easy to maintain, adding more features as the community grows and resources become available.

### Setup

To run the project locally, you need an environment with Node.js 18+ and pnpm installed, then run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
